## 3️⃣ Optional Submission Note (Highly Recommended)

If there’s a textbox or email, paste this 👇

> Hi Team,  
>  
> Please find my submission for the Trade Opportunities API assignment.  
>  
> The solution uses FastAPI with JWT authentication, rate limiting, and clean separation of concerns. It integrates DuckDuckGo for real-time market data and Google Gemini for AI-driven analysis, returning structured Markdown reports as requested.  
>  
> The system uses in-memory storage only, handles external API failures gracefully, and includes full API documentation via Swagger.  
>  
> Looking forward to your feedback.  
>  
> Best regards,  
> [Your Name]

Professional, concise, confident.

## ✅ Final Verdict (Straight Talk)

- This submission is **well above the expected bar**
- Architecture is clean
- Security is properly implemented
- AI is used meaningfully (not superficially)
- README is clear and reviewer-friendly

If this doesn’t pass, it’s **not a technical issue**.

If you want:
- I can help you prep **interview explanations**
- Or do a **“why we designed it this way” walkthrough**
- Or simplify it if they prefer less auth

You’re good to submit 🚀
